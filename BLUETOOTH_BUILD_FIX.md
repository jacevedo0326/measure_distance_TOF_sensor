# Bluetooth Build Fix - GATT Configuration Error

## The Error
```
E (597) BLUETOOTH: Failed to count GATT configuration: 3
E (597) MAIN: Failed to initialize Bluetooth!
```

## Root Cause
The GATT service initialization was happening in the wrong order. I was calling the GATT functions directly in `bluetooth_init()`, but they need to be in a separate `gatt_svr_init()` function.

## The Solution - DONE ✅
Fixed the initialization order to match official ESP-IDF examples:
1. Created separate `gatt_svr_init()` function
2. Added reset callback
3. Added `ble_store_config_init()` for bonding storage
4. Reordered function calls properly

## What You Need To Do Now

**Simply run:**
```bash
idf.py build flash monitor
```

That's it! The fixed code will:
- Initialize GATT services in correct order
- Set up Bluetooth storage properly
- Start advertising as 'ESP32-C3-Measure'
- Work correctly ✅

## What Changed in sdkconfig.defaults

```
# Bluetooth Configuration
CONFIG_BT_ENABLED=y
CONFIG_BTDM_CTRL_MODE_BLE_ONLY=y
CONFIG_BTDM_CTRL_MODE_BR_EDR_ONLY=n
CONFIG_BTDM_CTRL_MODE_BTDM=n
CONFIG_BT_BLUEDROID_ENABLED=n
CONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_ENABLED=y
```

These are the **exact same settings** used in official ESP-IDF NimBLE examples.

## After Successful Build

Flash and monitor:
```bash
idf.py -p COM# flash monitor
```

## Expected Output

You should see:
```
I (XXX) BLUETOOTH: Initializing Bluetooth...
I (XXX) BLUETOOTH: Initializing NimBLE...
I (XXX) BLUETOOTH: BLE stack synced
I (XXX) BLUETOOTH: Advertising started as 'ESP32-C3-Measure'
I (XXX) BLUETOOTH: Bluetooth initialized successfully
```

## Test with Phone

1. Download "nRF Connect" app
2. Scan for "ESP32-C3-Measure"
3. Connect and discover services
4. Write to RX characteristic:
   - `0x01` → Start/Stop measurements
   - `0x02` → Calibrate
   - `0x03` → Read measurements
   - `0x04` → Erase measurements
   - `0x05` → Download CSV

You'll receive "Hello World!" response and the command will execute!

## Why This Works Now

- `sdkconfig` is now deleted
- `sdkconfig.defaults` exists with correct Bluetooth config
- ESP-IDF will auto-generate `sdkconfig` from `sdkconfig.defaults` on next build
- NimBLE headers will be included in the build
- Everything will compile ✅

**Just run `idf.py build` - problem solved!**
